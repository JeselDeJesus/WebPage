            <h3>Azure Deer/Grey Deer</h3>
            <p>The Azure Deer got a bit of spotlight when Rill Boismortier fought during the Royal Knight Exam. Rill is a legit talent who even outclassed the gifted Yuno in battle, 
                with Yuno using his superior knowledge of the rules rather than being stronger..</p>

            <h3>BLACK BULLS</h3>
            <p>The most developed group in the series, it’s not a surprise they'd make it this high. They’ve got Captain Yami, who’s yet to show the full depths of his strength. 
                He’s constantly getting better and has a ton of talented mages working for him too. Noelle has already beaten her brother, Solid, and seems like she might be her 
                family’s most powerful mage. Meanwhile, some of their other mages all have unique magical abilities, and while the group might be small in raw numbers, 
                their power is greater than almost every other group.</p>

            <h3>GOLDEN DAWN</h3>
            <p>Golden Dawn’s power is in numbers and strength. William Vangeance is one of the most powerful Captains in the series, but he’s not the only one who matters. 
                He’s also got Yuno on his side, who’s power over wind magic is unparalleled. At the same time, Mimosa Vermillion is a solid healer with good strategic capabilities. 
                Klaus is also great for defensive abilities, and Langris was an amazing Vice-Captain in terms of power. His ability to cast spatial magic made him a dangerous threat, 
                and with all five of them, it’s questionable that anyone could get away with a victory.</p>

            <h3>CRIMSON LION</h3>
            <p>The Crimson Lion are arguable for either third or fourth in the series. Mereoleona alone is enough to earn them this spot. The Uncrowned, 
                Undefeated Lioness was able to go head to head with a bunch of Magic Knights with their magic boosted and survive. They also have Fuegoleon, 
                their Captain, who has the power of one of the series’ most powerful magical summons on their side. And that’s without counting some of their other 
                talented members.</p>

            <h3>CORAL PEACOCK</h3>
            <p>Coral Peacock is another guild that is not shown very often. Dorothy Unsworth is usually asleep, but she boasts a pretty impressive ability to create anything 
                she wants within her dream world. Even being taken over by an elf didn’t stop her, as she was able to use her powers to take care of the elf. She’s also got Kirsch 
                Vermillion, a showy but talented Vice-Captain who led his team to a victory in the Royal Knight Exam.</p>

            <h3>BLUE ROSE</h3>
            <p>Blue Rose’s Captain has been shown in battle far less than some of the other Captains, and that’s why she’s not very high on this list. 
                The rest of her guild is made up of people who've barely gotten to show off their fighting abilities, and only Sol has actually put in any real work. 
                Charlotte Roselei is a powerful warrior, and we see that during her fight with Yami, but that was while she had her power boosted by an elf. On the whole, 
                the Blue Rose doesn’t stand out nearly enough to make it into the top of the groups.

            <h3>SILVER EAGLE</h3>
            <p>The Silver Eagle group is known for being home to many of the Silva nobility, which makes them the head location for Nozel and his siblings, Solid and Nebra. 
                All of them have unique talents which place them far above any of the others on this list, with Nebra having some powerful mist magic and Solid boasting some water
                 magic.

            <h3>PURPLE ORCA</h3>
            <p>There’s not really much fans know about this guild. Its original leader was Gueldre, who was completely untrustworthy and wound up getting smacked around by Rill,
                 leader of the Azure Deer. Eventually, he was replaced by Kaiser, who wields powerful Vortex Magic, but fans don’t really know much about the rest of the squad. 
                 Their Vice-Captain was easily defeated by the Black Bulls’ Zora Ideale, so their two best people aren’t impressive at all.

            <h3>GREEN MANTIS</h3>
            <p>The Green Mantis squad is the epitome of mediocrity even in the series. When they were ranked in the series, they ranked at six and that essentially aligns with 
                what they’re capable of. Their squad includes Sekke, who’s more of a comic relief guy than an actual fighter. Jack is an incredibly sharp Captain, 
                but no one else on the team is a real threat, and there’s a reason why the anime rarely focuses on them.
